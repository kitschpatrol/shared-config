**A single dependency and single command to configure and run various code linters and tools.**

<!-- /description -->

## Overview

It's a shared [CSpell](https://cspell.org) config.

**See [`@kitschpatrol/shared-config`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kitschpatrol/shared-config) for the recommended single-package approach.**

## Setup

Splanh

To use just this CSpell config in isolation:

1. Install the `.npmrc` in your project root. This is required for correct PNPM behavior:

   ```sh
   pnpm dlx @kitschpatrol/repo-config init
   ```

2. Add the package:

   ```sh
   pnpm add -D @kitschpatrol/cspell-config
   ```

3. Add the starter `.cspell.json` file to your project root, and add any customizations you'd like:

   ```sh
   pnpm exec cspell-config init
   ```

## Usage

The CSpell binary should be picked up automatically by VS Code plugins.

You can call it directly, or use the script bundled with the config.

Integrate with your `package.json` scripts as you see fit, for example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "spellcheck": "cspell-config lint"
  }
}
```

### CLI

## Configuration

### Disabling bundled dictionaries

In additional to CSpell's default dictionary configuration, this shared configuration enables a number of dictionaries that ship with CSpell for all file types:

- [`lorem-ipsum`](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts/blob/main/dictionaries/lorem-ipsum/dict/lorem.txt)
- [`git`](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts/blob/main/dictionaries/git/cspell-ext.json)
- [`gaming-terms`](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts/blob/main/dictionaries/gaming-terms/dict/gaming-terms.txt)
- [`npm`](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts/blob/main/dictionaries/npm/dict/npm.txt)
- [`data-science`](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts/blob/main/dictionaries/data-science/dict/data-science.txt)
- [`fullstack`](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts/blob/main/dictionaries/fullstack/dict/fullstack.txt)

It also includes a number of _custom_ dictionaries distributed with this package, all of which are enabled by default:

- `kp-acronyms` Contains acronyms
- `kp-brands` Contains proper nouns like brand names
- `kp-eslint` Names seen in eslint rules provided by `@kitschpatrol/eslint-config`
- `kp-files` File extensions and types
- `kp-misc` Contains general and miscellaneous words
- `kp-names` Human names and usernames
- `kp-tech` Tech-specific terminology, some ambiguity vs. "brands"

In your project's root `.cspell.json`, you can disable any combination of these dictionaries by adding them to the `dictionaries` array with a `!` prefix.

For example, do disable the `kp-acronyms` and `kp-brands` dictionaries:

```jsonc
{
  "import": "@kitschpatrol/cspell-config",
  "dictionaries": [
    "!kp-acronyms",
    "!kp-brands",
    // ...Addtional !-prefixed dicitonary names
  ],
}
```

If you need a massive and permissive dictionary for large writing project, take a look at [@kitschpatrol/dict-en-wiktionary](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/dict-en-wiktionary).

### Adding project-scoped words

In your project's root `.cspell.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "import": "@kitschpatrol/cspell-config",
  "words": [
    "mountweazel",
    "steinlaus",
    "jungftak",
    "esquivalience",
    // ...Additional words
  ],
}
```

## Notes

This config includes a bunch of words I've happened to have needed to use. Your preferences will vary.

CSpell is configured to automatically ignore files and paths in `.gitignore` (via `"useGitignore": true`), and to ignore words inside of ` ``` ` code fences in markdown and mdx files.

As part of the `lint` command process, `@kitschpatrol/cspell-config` also runs a check to identify any words in your config file's `"words"` array that are _do not_ actually appear anywhere else in your project. This was inspired by [Zamiell's](https://github.com/Zamiell) [cspell-check-unused-words](https://github.com/complete-ts/cspell-check-unused-words) project.
