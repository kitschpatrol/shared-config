**Repository configuration and GitHub workflows for @kitschpatrol/shared-config.**

<!-- /description -->

## Overview

It's a `pnpm`-flavored shared config with some essential files for a fresh repo, plus automated linting for things like copyright notice dates, all accessible via a bundled command like tool named `kpi-repo`.

This includes the following:

- [`.npmrc`](https://pnpm.io/npmrc) with hoisting patterns for `kpi` tool access
- `.gitignore` with typical patterns
- `.vscode` extension recommendations (additional settings and recommendations come from other `@kitschpatrol/shared-config` packages)
- `.github` folder with workflows:
  - `github-release.yml` Automates turning turning vX.X.X tags on main into GitHub releases with changelogs
  - `set-github-metadata.yml` Populates GitHub repo metadata from package.json

In order to work around some hoisting issues related to plugin resolution in the other `@kitschpatrol/shared-config` packages, it's critical that it is applied _before_ any other `@kitschpatrol/shared-config` packages are installed.

<!-- recommendation -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **You can use this package on its own, but it's recommended to use [`@kitschpatrol/shared-config`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kitschpatrol/shared-config) instead for a single-dependency and single-package approach to linting and fixing your project.**
>
> This package is included as a dependency in [`@kitschpatrol/shared-config`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kitschpatrol/shared-config), which also automatically invokes the command line functionality in this package via its `kpi` command

## Setup

### Run-once approach

If you just need to set up your `.npmrc` in anticipation of installing another shared config, you can run the script via `dlx` to copy the `.npmrc` to your home folder:

```sh
pnpm dlx @kitschpatrol/repo-config init
```

### Installation approach

Optionally, you can install the package if you think you'll ever want to regenerate the repo config files.

1. Add the package:

   ```sh
   pnpm add -D @kitschpatrol/repo-config
   ```

2. If / when you need to regenerate the repo config files, you can run the bundled script:

   ```sh
   pnpm exec kpi-repo init
   ```

### GitHub Configuration

There are two options for authenticating the release workflow action:

#### GitHub Token

1. Ensure that read / write permissions are set for actions on the repository under Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions.

#### Personal Access token

If you want releases to come from your account instead of `github_actions`, then:

1. Create a [fine-grained personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) in your GitHub account with the following permissions:

   | Permission     | Access         |
   | -------------- | -------------- |
   | Administration | Read and write |
   | Contents       | Read and write |
   | Metadata       | Read-only      |

2. Add the token as a secret to your new GitHub repository.

   You can do this through the GitHub website under the _Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions_ page under the key `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

   Alternately, you can do this locally with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) and a credential manager like [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/):

   ```sh
   gh secret set PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN --app actions --body $(op read 'op://Personal/GitHub Mika/PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN')
   ```

### GitHub Actions

Note: Action dependencies have been forked.
